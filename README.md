The task at hand involves developing a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying diabetes outcomes based on various medical features. The dataset contains samples from individuals, and the goal is to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.

Background:

Diabetes is a widely recognized and extensively studied medical condition due to its significant impact on public health. Accurately classifying diabetes outcomes based on various medical features is essential for healthcare, epidemiology, and medical research. These features encompass a range of physiological and clinical measurements, including blood glucose levels, BMI (Body Mass Index), age, and blood pressure. Developing a precise classification model for diabetes is critical for understanding the disease's patterns, improving patient care, and conducting research in the field of diabetes management and prevention.

Dataset Description:

The diabetes dataset contains informations about various factors related to diabetes such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels and glucose levels  of a 770 persons . The task is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the whether the person is affected by the diabetes or not  based on its feature measurements.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their health-related attributes and medical history. The model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


Dataset Source:

The dataset is publicly available and commonly used for educational and research purposes. It is available in kaggle web site .

Key Deliverables:

A  trained classification model capable of accurately predicting the diabetes.    
Model evaluation results, including accuracy and other relevant classification metrics.
Visualizations depicting feature distributions, decision boundaries, and any insights gained from exploratory data analysis.
